# Global Hedge AI Mobile App APK
# This is a placeholder file for the actual APK
# In production, this would be replaced with the actual built APK file

# To build the actual APK:
# 1. Navigate to apps/mobile directory
# 2. Run: npx expo build:android
# 3. Replace this file with the generated APK

# For now, this serves as a placeholder for testing the download functionality
